    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <!--This is internal JS.
        <script>alert( 'Welcome to learn JavaScript!' );</script> -->
        <script src="script.js"></script>
        <!--add external JS file in the end of the body as such,
        also if it's internal it will load the JS before other stuff: alert() is method which is triggered before html (point of is to alert you about something). So it is still valid, that scripts should be in the end but alert() just want to jump in before html. To avoid it, you have to use onload event, which we cover later on.-->
